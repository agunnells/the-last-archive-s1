### The Chaos of Uncertainty: Rhetorical Archival Construction and Truth in Jill Lepore's *The Last Archive*

What common tropes do we rely on when describing the archive? How are medium-specific tools utilized to reinforce these descriptions? In this paper, I contend that the rhetorical charge of such descriptions becomes a means of establishing ethos for the narratives we tell through the archive. This paper opens with a brief theoretical overview of common stereotypes for describing the archive. By drawing on scholars including Juan Ilerbaig, Barbara Biesecker and others, this overview highlights themes of material accumulation and notions of fact that still influence rhetorics of the archive. Next, I utilize historian Jill Lepore’s podcast *The Last Archive* as a case study to examine how a narrator can establish credibility via their reliance on archival tropes. This analysis will focus on the first episodes of the first season: “The Clue of the Blue Bottle,” “Detection of Deception,” “The Invisible Lady,” and “Unheard.” To start, I consider how Lepore rhetorically constructs a space she terms “the last archive” through verbal description and the auditory elements available via the podcasting. Finally, I argue that Lepore capitalizes on the credibility afforded to her through the last archive to craft her own version of evidence. Ultimately, I argue that *The Last Archive* presents a valuable case study for understanding how rhetorical constructions of the archive create a foundation from which a narrator can present their own version of particular events, one that is nonetheless couched in notions of fact and evidence.

 This paper focuses on several common archival tropes that circulate in popular discourse: a natural process of material accumulation, the rhetoric of “buried treasure,” and a belief that archival objects can be treated as fact. In his article “Archives as sediments: metaphors of deposition and archival thinking,” Juan Ilerbaig explores the historical connection between archival science and geologic thinking. In particular, he points to the tendency of archival science to compare archives to sedimentary deposits.[^1] Ilerbaig argue that these metaphors paint the archive as a “natural, organic, spontaneously growing” product.[^2] In other words, Ilerbaig suggests that these metaphors frame the archive as a space where materials continuously accumulate through natural processes.[^3] These metaphors of accumulation create the foundation for another archival trope: the allure of “buried treasure.” Put another way, the concept of incessant material accumulation creates an implicit argument regarding the potential for discoveries buried within the archive. For instance, in her posthuman reading of subterranean archives, Shannon Mattern demonstrates how possibilities of discovery even inform contemporary digitization practices: “Might as well store *everything* for speculative data mining; you never know what treasure you might extract someday.”[^4]

These tropes situate the archive as a naturally occurring space of material accumulation, with buried objects awaiting discovery. Ultimately, this rhetoric paints the archive as a space of evidence that exists beyond human influence. In Barbara Biesecker’s analysis of the archive, she argues that archival objects are too often considered stable entities that speak on their own behalf.[^5] Here, Biesecker speaks to similar themes raised by Ilerbaig in his study of archival rhetorics: by failing to address the human mediation in archival objects, these objects are granted the “evidentiary status of fact.” [^6] Similarly, Brien Brothman points to the common dichotomy of truth/untruth used to describe archival materials, arguing that such a dichotomy encourages researchers to place implicit trust in objects due solely to their inclusion in an archive.[^7]

Through the first four episodes of The Last Archive, Lepore relies heavily on these archival tropes. Each episode follows the same general structure: she visits a place she terms “the last archive” and utilizes the archival objects she “discovers” within to understand events in United States history. From the start, Lepore’s descriptions of the last archive echo Ilerbaig’s focus on natural accumulation. Lepore opens the first episode, titled “The Clue of the Blue Bottle,” by stating, “There’s a place in our world where the known things go. A corridor of the mind. Along the walls, shelves stuffed with proof. And all around, the clutter of clues.”[^8] Lepore’s descriptions of the last archive paint it as a physical space that already exists; in other words, though Lepore rhetorically invents the last archive, she strives to characterize it as a naturally occurring space. Through the phrase “there’s a place in the world,” Lepore reinforces the sense of spontaneous occurrence by omitting human influence in creating the last archive.
