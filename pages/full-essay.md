### The Chaos of Uncertainty: Rhetorical Archival Construction and Truth in Jill Lepore's *The Last Archive*

What common tropes do we rely on when describing the archive? How are medium-specific tools utilized to reinforce these descriptions? In this paper, I contend that the rhetorical charge of such descriptions becomes a means of establishing ethos for the narratives we tell through the archive. This paper opens with a brief theoretical overview of common stereotypes for describing the archive. By drawing on scholars including Juan Ilerbaig, Barbara Biesecker and others, this overview highlights themes of material accumulation and notions of fact that still influence rhetorics of the archive. Next, I utilize historian Jill Lepore’s podcast *The Last Archive* as a case study to examine how a narrator can establish credibility via their reliance on archival tropes. This analysis will focus on the first episodes of the first season: “The Clue of the Blue Bottle,” “Detection of Deception,” “The Invisible Lady,” and “Unheard.” To start, I consider how Lepore rhetorically constructs a space she terms “the last archive” through verbal description and the auditory elements available via the podcasting. Finally, I argue that Lepore capitalizes on the credibility afforded to her through the last archive to craft her own version of evidence. Ultimately, I argue that *The Last Archive* presents a valuable case study for understanding how rhetorical constructions of the archive create a foundation from which a narrator can present their own version of particular events, one that is nonetheless couched in notions of fact and evidence.

 This paper focuses on several common archival tropes that circulate in popular discourse: a natural process of material accumulation, the rhetoric of “buried treasure,” and a belief that archival objects can be treated as fact. In his article “Archives as sediments: metaphors of deposition and archival thinking,” Juan Ilerbaig explores the historical connection between archival science and geologic thinking. In particular, he points to the tendency of archival science to compare archives to sedimentary deposits.[^1] Ilerbaig argue that these metaphors paint the archive as a “natural, organic, spontaneously growing” product.[^2] In other words, Ilerbaig suggests that these metaphors frame the archive as a space where materials continuously accumulate through natural processes.[^3] These metaphors of accumulation create the foundation for another archival trope: the allure of “buried treasure.” Put another way, the concept of incessant material accumulation creates an implicit argument regarding the potential for discoveries buried within the archive. For instance, in her posthuman reading of subterranean archives, Shannon Mattern demonstrates how possibilities of discovery even inform contemporary digitization practices: “Might as well store *everything* for speculative data mining; you never know what treasure you might extract someday.”[^4]

These tropes situate the archive as a naturally occurring space of material accumulation, with buried objects awaiting discovery. Ultimately, this rhetoric paints the archive as a space of evidence that exists beyond human influence. In Barbara Biesecker’s analysis of the archive, she argues that archival objects are too often considered stable entities that speak on their own behalf.[^5] Here, Biesecker speaks to similar themes raised by Ilerbaig in his study of archival rhetorics: by failing to address the human mediation in archival objects, these objects are granted the “evidentiary status of fact.” [^6] Similarly, Brien Brothman points to the common dichotomy of truth/untruth used to describe archival materials, arguing that such a dichotomy encourages researchers to place implicit trust in objects due solely to their inclusion in an archive.[^7]

Through the first four episodes of The Last Archive, Lepore relies heavily on these archival tropes. Each episode follows the same general structure: she visits a place she terms “the last archive” and utilizes the archival objects she “discovers” within to understand events in United States history. From the start, Lepore’s descriptions of the last archive echo Ilerbaig’s focus on natural accumulation. Lepore opens the first episode, titled “The Clue of the Blue Bottle,” by stating, “There’s a place in our world where the known things go. A corridor of the mind. Along the walls, shelves stuffed with proof. And all around, the clutter of clues.”[^8] Lepore’s descriptions of the last archive paint it as a physical space that already exists; in other words, though Lepore rhetorically invents the last archive, she strives to characterize it as a naturally occurring space. Through the phrase “there’s a place in the world,” Lepore reinforces the sense of spontaneous occurrence by omitting human influence in creating the last archive.

Numerous other descriptions of the clutter in the last archive parallel the image of sedimentary deposition posited by Ilerbaig. When speaking of archival sedimentation, Ilerbaig notes, “The metaphorical link is meant to capture the spontaneity and quasi-automatic or mechanical character of archival accumulation, along with its constant and progressive nature.”[^9] In the first episode of the podcast, Lepore gestures to different items that have built up in the archive: “a photograph of a corpse, pasted onto the page of a moldering leather-bound album” and “a teetering stack of newspapers tied with twine.”[^10] References to moldering and teetering objects suggest a space in which items are continually buried under further accumulation. Lepore insists on this sense of accumulation throughout the first four episodes. For instance, in the third episode, “The Invisible Lady,” Lepore describes “poking” around the last archive, eventually coming across an essay about Emily Dickinson.[^11] Building on this theme, Lepore begins the fourth episode, “Unheard,” by commenting on the mess she finds in the last archive, lamenting that “half the time, I can’t find what I came for.”[^12] The recurrence of such descriptions throughout Lepore’s podcast accomplishes a specific purpose: by articulating the last archive as a naturally occurring space, Lepore establishes the evidentiary value of the materials buried within the archive.

As scholars note, the lure of geological metaphors in archival rhetoric rests in part on the resulting possibilities for discovery. The hope of buried treasure, and the thrill of its discovery, reappears throughout The Last Archive. In “The Clue of the Blue Bottle,” Lepore travels to the Vermont State Archives to find trial transcripts that had been “buried deep” within its walls.[^13] In fact, the trial transcripts were lost for several years; the archivist who recovered them, Gregory Sandford, recalls the thrill that arises during the “moment of discovery” when a previously lost item is unearthed.[^14] The trial transcripts ultimately represent the kind of treasure proposed by Mattern: in Lepore’s case, the recovered transcripts may hold the key to the case she is researching on the murder of Lucina Broadwell. So much of Lepore’s podcast revolves around this metaphorical quest for buried treasure; in “The Invisible Lady,” Lepore describes “hunting” the invisible lady in the last archive by overturning boxes, unlocking ancient trunks, and otherwise searching for something hidden.[^15]

Thus far, I have focused on the common tropes in archival rhetoric that Lepore uses to verbally describe the last archive. However, such spoken descriptions are not the only tool at her disposal; though spoken word generally maintains its position at the top of the sonic hierarchy, her use of sound effects deserves attention.[^16] Throughout the podcast, Lepore utilizes sound effects to reinforce the verbal descriptions she provides of the last archive. Scholars of radio drama such as Bonnie Miller trace the ways in which the ear was conceptualized as a mode of seeing in the early- to mid-twentieth century.[^17] Miller draws on Susan Douglas’s two cognitive modes of listening – dimensional listening and associational listening – to understand how sound effects create a mental image for the listener.[^18] Of particular interest for this paper is associational listening, wherein auditory stimuli invoke memories or images already familiar to most listeners.[^19] In other words, I suggest that Lepore uses sound effects to reinforce a mental image of a stereotypical archival space in the listener’s mind. In “The Clue of the Blue Bottle,” the listener hears creaking footsteps and the squeak of an opening door as Lepore introduces the last archive.[^20] These sound effects reappear at the beginning of each of the four episodes analyzed in this paper. Beyond indicating a physical space to the listener, such sound effects suggest an old, dilapidated space; for example, creaking floorboards bring to mind a decaying floor. When coupled with descriptions of her searching in the “recesses” of the last archive, Lepore’s repeated use of these sound effects reinforces the stereotype of the dusty, neglected archive full of accumulating materials waiting to be unearthed.[^21]

Why does Lepore return time and again to these verbal and auditory descriptions of the last archive? What rhetorical purpose do they serve? I argue that, by reinforcing the aspects of stereotypical archival spaces as creaky, antiquated, and unexplored, Lepore asserts the “truth” or evidentiary nature of the archival items she engages with. It is helpful here to recall Ilerbaig’s study of archival rhetorics discussed earlier in this section. Through her descriptions of the last archive, Lepore relies on historical tropes of the archive that paint it as a naturally occurring, organic entity. Furthermore, the “fact” of archival documents highlighted by scholars such as Biesecker remains an implicit part of Lepore’s ethos. When introducing the last archive at the beginning of “The Clue of the Blue Bottle,” Lepore claims that this archive is all that stands between us and the “chaos of uncertainty.”[^22] I want to focus on Lepore’s assertion that these archival objects protect us from not knowing. The answers we need are here in the archive; we simply need to let the objects speak.

Throughout The Last Archive, Lepore derives her authority from these archival materials. In part, she must rely on the truthfulness of the archival objects she engages with due to the nature of podcasting as a medium for storytelling. In the sensory hierarchy, sight reigns supreme: it is prioritized as a way to understand truth and identify evidence. Yet in The Last Archive, Lepore works in an auditory medium in which she must compensate for the “lack” of sight. In particular, Lepore utilizes reenactments reminiscent of radio drama as a means of visualizing the evidence presented in her podcast; the reenactment provides a means for the listener to see this evidence. To put it another way: “Radio drama is not blind. It’s just a different way of seeing.”[^23] Many of the reenactments included in the four episodes discussed in this podcast rely directly on the archival objects Lepore finds in the last archive. As she notes in the first episode, “Most everything our actors say in this podcast is taken from historical documents – we know they said this stuff.”[^24] For instance, a significant portion of “The Clue of the Blue Bottle” focuses on reenacting the proceedings of George Long’s trial. Most of the trial transcripts were printed for the public; the portions of the transcript held from the public were accessed via the Vermont State Archives.[^25] Similarly, the second episode, titled “Detection of Deception,” explores the invention of the lie detector. Early in the episode, the listener is privy to a reenactment of the transcript recorded during a police interrogation of James Alphonso Frye for the murder of Dr. R. W. Brown.[^26] In both instances, Lepore reinforces the truth of her topics via these reenactments. Not only does she provide “facts” from a historical record, but the reenactments allow the audience to “see” the truth.

Let us pause here for a moment and consider these reenactments. We can acknowledge Lepore’s access to the historical documents “found” in the last archive and recognize the credibility of such documents.[^27] Yet, we must question Lepore’s quest to help her listeners “see” the “truth.” The Last Archive follows in a tradition of contemporary podcasts that borrow a style from early- to mid-twentieth century radio production referred to by scholars as the “storytelling” approach.[^28] While Lepore reenacts content from the archival objects she finds, she nonetheless relies on the hallmarks of radio production – including speech, music, and noise – to present a dramatized narrative.[^29] Take, for instance, a reenacted portion of Frye’s murder trial in the episode “Detection of Deception.” Frye’s lawyer asks if Judge McCoy will allow the results of the lie detector test to be admitted as evidence; the judge responds by lambasting the use of such pseudo-science in a court of law.[^30] While Lepore utilizes the trial transcript as the basis for the reenactment, we must acknowledge that other portions of the reenactment are fictional or dramatized for narrative effect. As the judge presents his opinion of the lie detector, faint ominous music plays in the background; the judge’s condescending tone is reinforced by his emphasis on the “p” as he snidely derides the “pamphlets” submitted to him on the subject of systolic blood pressure tests.[^31] How does Lepore know that the judge spoke with this tone? Surely there was no ominous music playing in the courtroom.

Lepore’s reenactments reveal larger concerns regarding the ability to demonstrate “truth” for the audience. As scholars like Leslie McMurtry have noted, these types of podcasts blur the line between creative nonfiction and factual reporting.[^32] In particular, McMurtry argues that, even though these types of podcasts depict the lives and activities of real people, they “nonetheless become characters” when represented in the framework of radio drama podcasting.[^33] These characters range from the obscure – such as Frye in “Detection of Deception” – to well-known figures including Emily Dickinson in “The Invisible Lady.” For instance, an actress voicing Emily Dickinson reads a portion of Dickinson’s poem “I’m Nobody! Who Are You?” out loud.[^34] Again, the tone and pacing of the actresses’ voice is dramatized– we do not know how Dickinson would have actually sounded when reading her poem out loud. Indeed, Dickinson becomes a character in Lepore’s podcast, with her reading of the poem serving Lepore’s larger argument regarding the Victorian desire to keep women away from public life.[^35]
